# pytorch-suggestive-annotation-a-deep-active-learning-framework-for-biomedical-image-segmentation

This is an PyTorch implementation of the model used in the paper [Suggestive Annotation: A Deep Active Learning Framework for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04737) though the model architecture in the model was very vague so I might have misinterpreted it, in which case please raise a pull request!
